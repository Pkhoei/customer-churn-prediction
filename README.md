# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset and builds end-to-end visual analytics using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Analyze churn-related patterns using SQL (via SQLite).
- Execute queries and process data in Python using `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
- Design interactive dashboards and KPIs using Power BI.
- Provide actionable insights for business stakeholders.
- Lay the foundation for future machine learning modeling (coming soon).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQLite** – for raw data storage and SQL-based querying
- **Python** – `pandas`, `sqlite3` for processing and exporting insights
- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and business storytelling
- **VS Code + Git** – development environment and version control

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- 📈 **Average Monthly Charge:** 64.76  
- 🔍 **Churn Rate:** Much higher in **Month-to-Month** contract customers  
- ✅ Final Power BI dashboards contain KPIs, filters, and contract-based churn analysis
